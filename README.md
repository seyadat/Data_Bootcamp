## 📊 My Data Analysis Bootcamp Journey

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Bootcamp Repository**!  
This space documents my learning journey, practice scripts, and evolving skills as I dive deeper into the world of data analytics.  

I recently completed an intensive bootcamp guided by **Alex The Analyst and other resourceful youtubers**, whose tutorials and mentorships have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of **SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python**.

##  Bootcamp Overview

Under Alex's guidance, I explored:

- **SQL** fundamentals and advanced queries  
- **Excel** for data cleaning and transformation  
- **Power BI** for building interactive dashboards  
- **Python** for data analysis and web scraping  

Each section in this repo reflects hands-on practice, including:

- SQL scripts for database creation, joins, and aggregations  
- Power BI dashboards for **Job Layoffs** and **Sales Analytics**  
- Python scripts for scraping, wrangling, and exporting data

## Dataset Notes

Some datasets used here differ slightly from those in Alex’s tutorials.  
I customized them to reflect **sales**, **Employee Data(with salary)** scenarios relevant to my work, including:

- Modified employee records  
- Additional salary and department fields  
- Realistic business use cases for dashboarding and reporting

This is just the beginning.  
I’m thrilled to continue this journey, refine my skills, and contribute to real-world analytics projects.
